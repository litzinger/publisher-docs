The initial beta release of Publisher 2 does not include support for the following features available in Publisher 1. This does not mean they will never be added, it just means they were cut in order to focus on releasing a stable base add-on. These features will be added back when time allows.

- Diffs

The following will be addressed after the beta period since they are separate supplemental add-ons and not a part of Publisher's codebase.

- Publisher Low Search
- Publisher Domain Control
- Publisher Language Control
- Publisher NavEE
