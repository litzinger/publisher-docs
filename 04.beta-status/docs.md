The initial beta release of Publisher 2 does not include support for the following features available in Publisher 1. This does not mean they will never be added, it just means they were cut in order to focus on releasing a stable base add-on. These features will be added back when time allows.

- Approvals
- Email notifications
- Translation status on entry list pages
- Support for:
    - Publisher Low Search
    - Publisher Domain Control
    - Publisher Language Control
    - Publisher NavEE
- Channel:Form support
- Diffs
